LinkedMDR stands for Linked Multimedia Document Representation.
The main purpose of this ontology is to provide the infrastructure to model the knowledge embedded in a heterogeneous document corpus of any domain-specific application. 

LinkedMDR is made of three main layers:
- The Core layer serving as a backbone and a mediator among the different layers;
- The Standardized Metadata layer linking descriptors of existing standards in metadata representation;
- The Pluggable Domain-Specific layer that can adapt to any domain-specific ontology.

The multi-layering of LinkedMDR ensures its genericity and extensibility.

This version of LinkedMDR is based on descriptors from DC (http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/), TEI (http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/Guidelines.pdf) and MPEG-7 (https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/mpeg-7) standards for the standardized metadata layer and an adapted version of the ifcOWL ontology (http://openbimstandards.org/standards/ifcowl/) for the pluggable domain-specific layer.
It is applied in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry.
